# Creating custom Middleware in ASP.NET Core Web API
This is small POC project based on Middleware in .NET core.
Middleware is peace of code through which every request and response passes. Middleware can be used for Authentication, Authorization, rounting and many more useful cases depending upon the need. One can create custom Middleware according to project requirements.

In this specific repository, I've created two custom Middlewares using both approaches provided by .NET.
* Using IMiddleware Interface
* Using RequestDelegate Directly
